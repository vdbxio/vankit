## TL;DR
VanKit (working name) is a collection of knowledge for living in a van with limited means. Its intention is to distill down the best of affordable options to allow for comfortable living in a vehicle of your choosing, likely a van. Not all sections will apply to everyone, but I hope that you can find help and or inspiration to proceed down the path of making a van your home becaue the housing market isn't gonna unfuck itself anytime soon and your landlord is only getting richer. Fuck that guy.

## Background

Well before succumbing to the housing market in the Bay Area, I was a techie designer that was enamoured by **#vanlife** videos on YouTube. Being more of a mechanically minded person, I'd sift through most of these videos for build ideas. While I still dream of a fully kitted out Dodge ProMaster, the reality, even when I was making low-end tech money, is that most of us can't afford that crap. Even a used ProMaster or Transit is $10,000 at the time of writing, then on top of that, your interior build. Even harder for a lot of people is trying to make sense of all the things that change when you enter vanlife... instagram models talking about minimalism and telling you how awesome their life is now is a major distraction. Let's get down to brass tacks. 

Wether you're working class and getting priced out of housing or already homeless and not looking forward to paying another landlord if that even becomes an option. I want to gather as many resources as possible because unfortunately, this shit is likely not gonna get any better. 

My personal story comes from buying a 97 Ford Aerostar for $400 (a lucky find) before I even went full time. I initially intended it to be a part time thing I could do when I ended up moving to the North Bay for a period of time. I would end up finding myself in the South Bay tabling art shows, and would many times not want to drive back to Vallejo. 

After a breakup, I had to move my stuff to a storage unit and begin living in my unfinished van build. I've learned quite a bit just by living in a half-built concept of what I wanted and allowing it to morph into what it is today. I'll also glean information from those I've seen on Youtube and other sources as my own build is likely not the most optimal for everyone. Also, please feel free to contribute.

I hope you can look at this document and see what works best for you.
