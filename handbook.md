This handbook is dedicated to those looking to embark on the journey of living off the grid. It is organized to give you the absolute basics to keep your gadgets and appliances powered with a starting point of minimal knowledge of electrical systems.

## Where to start?

Great question: Figure out what you need and what you don’t. - If you’re moving into a van and intend to only have a cell phone and a tablet, go get a decent cigarette adapter from your favorite store and plug it in to your car. Make sure your starter battery is in good condition and maybe don’t charge your devices unless the vehicle is running. 

Here’s a few options:

For anything more, or if you’re not living in a vehicle, you’ll want to isolate your house electrical from your vehicle’s electrical system and there’s many ways to do this, but first the basics.

## Sizing your system

Before we do this a little basics of how power is calculated. Power is usually represented in watts… if you look at many devices, somewhere you’ll see a power rating though many times this is represented in volts and amps. There’s a lot of info I could give you about this but the basics are:

Volts * Amps = Watts


Keep this in mind and start looking at the devices and appliances you plan on using in your off-grid home. Many times the volts and amps rating is on the power supply aka power brick or wall wort, but this is generally a maximum power draw. Keep in mind though, this is only when you are charging.

For example a common USB phone charger will draw 2.1a at 5v:

5 * 2.1 = 10.5 watts

This is how much your phone charger is drawing at its peak at any given time and we can then convert that to say a common 12v system by reversing the operation

10.5 / 12 = 0.875 amps @ 12v

I highly suggest you research this more if you want to get a better idea of how this works, but the basic math is all you need to get started and the following example will help you follow through the rest of this handbook.
